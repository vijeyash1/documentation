**Documentation for becoming a OIDC / 0Auth2.0 provider**

***Before Going further lets look into some of the important Terminologies***


*whats social login ?*
>   Social login is a single sign-on (SSO) technology that allows users to authenticate themselves on various applications and sites by connecting through a site which implements Oauth or OIDC **(in our case Intelops implements hydra which is a Oauth , OIDC provider)**  rather than typing a separate ID and password on each website.

*What is Authentication?*

> authentication means, **the user or computer has to prove its identity to the server or client**. Usually, authentication by a server entails the use of a user name and password. Other ways to authenticate can be through cards, retina scans, voice recognition, and fingerprints

*What is Authorization?*

>   Authorization is  **the process of giving someone permission to have access to something**.


**Some Terminologies around 0auth**


 - **Authorization server**: The server that issues access tokens to clients after successfully authenticating the resource owner and obtaining authorization.
 - **Resource owner**: The entity that can grant access to a protected resource. This is typically the end-user.
 - **Client**: An application that requests access to a protected resource on behalf of the resource owner.
 - **Resource server**: The server hosting the protected resources and capable of accepting and responding to protected resource requests using access tokens.
 - **Access token**: A token that is issued by the authorization server and used by the client to access the protected resources on the resource server.
 - **Refresh token**: A token that is issued by the authorization server and used by the client to obtain a new access token when the original access token becomes invalid or expires.
 - **Scope**: A list of permissions that the client can request to access protected resources on the resource server.
 - **Grant types**: The OAuth 2.0 specification defines several grant types, which indicate how the client can obtain an access token. Examples include authorization code, implicit, resource owner password credentials, and client credentials.
 - **Authorization code**: A grant type in which the client obtains an authorization code from the authorization server and exchanges it for an access token. This grant type is commonly used in server-side web applications.
 - **Implicit**: A grant type in which the authorization server issues an access token directly to the client. This grant type is commonly used in client-side web applications and mobile apps.
 - **Resource owner password credentials**: A grant type in which the client obtains an access token by presenting the resource owner's username and password to the authorization server.
 - **Client credentials**: A grant type in which the client obtains an access token by presenting its own credentials (client ID and secret) to the authorization server.



**Technologies Used**

 - **Kratos** : Kratos is a Authentication tool build by the Ory. we can leverage it for implementing authentication.
 - **Hydra** : _Ory Hydra_ is the most advanced OAuth 2.0 and OIDC CertifiedÂ® Server. we can leverage it for becoming a  OAuth 2.0 and OIDC provider.
 - **Postgres** : PostgreSQL, also known as Postgres, is a free and open-source relational database management system emphasizing extensibility and SQL compliance.

 - In the above docker compose we are running two services named kratos-migrate and kratos

 - kratos migrate is a service used for the migration of the scemas 
 - Kratos is a authentication service.

***In the above dockercompose file we have a kratosmigrate service in that we serve kratos.yml***

***Below I will provide a sample kratos.yml***

**A quick start guide to run Postgres using docker**

    postgresd:
    image: postgres:latest
    ports:
    - "5432:5432"   
    volumes:
    - ./pg-init-scripts:/docker-entrypoint-initdb.d
    environment:
    - POSTGRES_USER=${DB_USER}
    - POSTGRES_PASSWORD=${DB_PASSWORD}
    - POSTGRES_MULTIPLE_DATABASES=kratos,accesscontroldb,vizual,auth
    networks:
    - intranet
The official postgres dont have a provision to create multiple database during starting the Postgres instance using docker compose.

     set -e
    
    set -u
    
      
    
    function  create_user_and_database() {
    
    local database=$1
    
    echo  " Creating user and database '$database'"
    
    psql -v ON_ERROR_STOP=1 --username "$POSTGRES_USER"  <<-EOSQL
    
    CREATE USER $database;
    
    CREATE DATABASE $database;
    
    GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE $database TO $database;
    
    EOSQL
    
    } 
    if [ -n "$POSTGRES_MULTIPLE_DATABASES" ]; then
    
    echo  "Multiple database creation requested: $POSTGRES_MULTIPLE_DATABASES"
    
    for  db  in  $(echo $POSTGRES_MULTIPLE_DATABASES  | tr ','  '  '); do
    
    create_user_and_database $db
    
    done
    
    echo  "Multiple databases created"
    
    fi


we will serve this script into postgres instance which will give us the ability to create multiple database while starting the postgres instance.

    volumes:
    - ./pg-init-scripts:/docker-entrypoint-initdb.d
we can create a .sh file containg the above script and place it inside the **pg-init-scripts**  directory
